      <p>My hobby is read intresting and knowledgable books in my free time.Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completeing my homework.I am 12 years old and read in 7th standard.Now I know that reding is a very good habit which makes me complete.This hobby can developed in anyone however I got this naturally.Reading books keeps one happy and busy.It is a good source of enjoyment,knowlegde,inspiration and instruction.It makes us disciplined,loyal,punctual and most important a seccuesful person in the life.
